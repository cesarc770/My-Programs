# My School Projects

In this repository I have added some of the programs I have worked on while learning programming at the University of Utah. The goal was make programs that solve everyday problems encountered in the workplace or in our personal lives. I provide one of the many solutions to the problem. In here I provide the code to be seen and maybe used for personal projects of your own.

## Getting Started
These projects contain raw code and in order to have them run you would need to clone them into your computer and build them in order for them to run in your local machine. 

## Content Summary

### ManageBudget

Program written in C++. It asks for inputs on income and expenses and displays a simple budget. The program has a unique display that makes it easy to read when ran in the command line or terminal. This program was built and compiled using Emacs in a Linux environment.

###  MovieAnalizer

This program reads in data about movies from a text file, with tab separated values followed by binaries in order to indicate which of the 18 genres the movie belongs to. Then it uses the JCF classes to manipulate the data in order to answer several questions about the data. Written in Java.
  
### Manage Appointment

This program is written in Java. The system manages patient appointments with Doctors for just one day at a clinic. It simulates the creation of doctors, patient and appointments. In this program, I apply Object Oriented Programming concepts in order to create the simulation.

### SimpleCashCount

This simple program is built on C++ and it has very simple calculations using the moudulus operator. It was one of the first programs I wrote.
