#school-projects
In this reposirtory i have some of the projects I have worked on while taking programming classes at the University. I will continue to add more as I continue to finish mor eprojects at school. I also add some of my own creativity and way to complete the project since it can be done in so many different ways. The first goal is to get it to work and then I clean up my code and make it more functional and easy to understand.
