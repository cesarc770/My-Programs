#school-projects

In this reposirtory I have added some of the projects I have worked on while taking programming classes at the University. I will continue to add more as I continue to finish more projects at school. I also add some of my own creativity to this projects. The project can be done in so many different ways. I provide one of the many solutions to the problem. The first goal is to get it to work and then I clean up my code and make it more functional and easy to understand.
