# My Programs

In this reposirtory I have added some of the programs I have worked on while learning programming at the University. I will continue to add more as I continue my learning. The goal is to solve everyday problems encounter in the workplace or in our personal lives. I provide one of the many solutions to the problem. In here I provide the code to be seen and maybe used for personal projects of your own.

Content Summary:
  - ManageBudget : Program written in C++. It asks for inputs on income and expenses and displays a simple budget. The program has a unique display that makes it easy to read when ran in the command line or terminal. This program was built and compiled using Emacs in a Linux environment. 
 
  - MovieAnalizer : This program reads in data about movies from a text file, with tab separated values followed by binaries in order to indicate which of the 18 genres the movie belongs to. Then it uses the JCF classes to manipulate the data in order to answer several questions about the data. Written in Java.
  
  - Manage Appointment : This program is written in Java. The system manages patient appointments with Doctors for just one day at a clinic. It simulates the creation of doctors, patient and appointments. In this program, I apply Object Oriented Programming concepts in order to create the simulation. 
  
  - SimpleCashCount : This simple program is built on C++ and it has very simple calculations using the moudulus operator. It was one of the first programs I wrote.
